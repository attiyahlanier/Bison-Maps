1.  What works?

Phase I



2. What doesn't work?

Phase II & Phase III





3.  What did you learn?

I learned a lot about the capabilities of java. I never knew the complexities that went behind building such an application
or that it was achievable by students who had never programmed in java before. 





4. How did you solve problems? What resources did you use?

StackOverflow and YouTube were big helps. Google also helped answer all my questions. When the internet failed me, my 
classmates as well as upperclassmen students came to the rescue. 



5. For Phase III, who was on your team?  Did you have any problems with team members?

Lauren McKoy.






6. What are you going to do know with the code, and your new found knowledge?

First, I'm going to finish my code. I'm going to start  my own java projects with my new found knowlegde in order to 
maintain my proficiency. I want to further develop my skills in java to increase my competetiveness as a programmer.
